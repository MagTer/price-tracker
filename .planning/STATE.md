# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-01)

**Project code:** PT
**Core value:** After extraction, the agent platform's `priser` skill keeps working end-to-end via MCP-discovered tools served by this standalone repo, with all price-tracker code removed from the agent platform.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Skeleton + Domain Copy

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Skeleton + Domain Copy)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-05-01 — Roadmap created from EXTRACTION.md §8; 5 phases mapped to 40 v1 requirements

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Initialization: Single-user (Magnus-only) auth with `tenant_id` UUID column kept for future
- Initialization: Agent integration via MCP server (not REST), FastMCP library
- Initialization: OpenRouter direct (no LiteLLM proxy)
- Initialization: Squash 3 source migrations into one initial migration; drop `price_tracker_` table prefix

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phases must run sequentially despite `parallelization=true` in config — each gate is a precondition for the next phase's work. Plans within a phase may parallelize.
- Email backend (SMTP via aiosmtplib vs AWS SES) — decide during Phase 2
- MCP mount path (`/mcp` on same app vs separate Traefik subdomain) — decide during Phase 4
