"""Cloudflare Access identity: verify the JWT Access puts on every request it admits.

Behind Cloudflare Access (the Kubernetes cluster on home-server, STATEFUL-APPS-DESIGN
D6) there is no oauth2-proxy and no X-Auth-Request-Email. Access forwards the user's
email as a plain `Cf-Access-Authenticated-User-Email` header too, and measured on the
lab (U2, 2026-09-30) a client-supplied copy of that header does not reach the origin.
It is still not read here: a plain header is only as good as every hop that could add
one, while the signed `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion` proves itself. Measured in the same
run, a forged assertion is REPLACED by Cloudflare's own, and a service-token request
carries a valid assertion with NO email claim, so "verified" does not imply "a person".

The verification is the one Cloudflare documents: RS256 only, signed by a key from the
team's certs endpoint, `aud` containing this application's AUD tag, `iss` the team
domain, and not expired.

A SECOND COPY lives in MagTer/logsink-shim `src/logsink_shim/cf_access.py`, verbatim
from 0db887e (home-server APPLOGS-MIGRATION-DESIGN A3): the two apps release separately
and share no package. A fix here belongs there in the same sitting.
